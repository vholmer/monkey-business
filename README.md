Don Aper, is that really you? It's me, your old college buddy from monkey business school. My God, it's been ages! I've heard through the ape-vines that you've climbed the ranks of the massive multibillion banana trading company Costa Banana, and that you now hold the rank of CEO, the top banana of the organization. It's an ape-eat-ape world out there. To survive in this harsh business, you need to buy LOW and sell HIGH!

The BNAN index is constantly moving. Time your transactions well, Don Aper.
